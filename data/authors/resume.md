## About Me

I am a PHP developer with solid expertise in using the Laravel framework. I also have experience in
managing Linux and FreeBSD operating systems. I have several projects documented on gitHub that
demonstrate my abilities and skills in software development.

## Projects

- [**Steganography**](https://github.com/brynwibowo/stegano-lsb)

  Steganography project, which is a program written in PHP that hides text within an image using the least significant bit method. This program allows users to encrypt a message and embed it into an image file, making the message invisible to the naked eye. The embedded message can only be retrieved by using the corresponding key and running the program again. This program is useful for securely sending sensitive information, such as passwords or confidential documents, over the internet. The program's demonstration can be done by running the script, then providing the image file and the text you want to hide, it will output an image file that is the same as the original image with the hidden text.

- [**Larablog**](https://github.com/brynwibowo/larablog)

  I have a website project for schools and pesantren, built using PHP Laravel as the backend framework and Bootstrap as the frontend framework. The website features include a public blog, student-written blog, photo gallery of school/pesantren events, and contact information. The website allows easy communication between school/pesantren administration, teachers, students and parents. The demonstration of the website can be done by visiting the website and explore the features such as viewing the blog, gallery, and contact info.
